# docker-kibana-k8s-search-guard

We followed [this documentation](https://docs.search-guard.com/latest/kibana-plugin-installation.html) to configure an official Kibana Docker image to include Search Guard.

Please use it with [our Elasticsearch docker image](https://github.com/xanthous-tech/docker-es-k8s-search-guard).
